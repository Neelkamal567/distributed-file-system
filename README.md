Distributed File System with Fault Tolerance

This project is developed in C as part of an Operating Systems course.
It simulates a distributed file system with the following features:

- File replication across multiple nodes
- Fault tolerant file access
- Node failure simulation
- Node recovery mechanism
- Menu driven interface

The project demonstrates basic concepts of distributed systems
and fault tolerance using simple data structures in C.
